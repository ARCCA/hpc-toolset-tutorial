## Requirements

For this tutorial you will need to have docker installed on your local machine.  This has been tested on Linux, MacOS, and Windows 10:

- docker version 19.03.8+
- docker-compose 1.25.2+

NOTE: For Windows, if you haven't already done so, you will need to configure git not to convert line endings into Windows format.  Run this command before cloning the tutorial repo:
```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```
